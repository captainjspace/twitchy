# twitchy
* Vanilla JS
* Uses ES6 features
* Has gratuitous js to emphasize control of DOM
* template literals are awesome would never have used those unless going Vanilla

# The app
[Twitchy](https://captainjspace.github.io/twitchy/)

## TODO
* could do with a refactor pass
* have fun with all the other data in the stream
* clean up css/app.css contains somewhat redundant formatting
* main app.js should be refined to a class with methods
* JSToken from Twitch for cleaner integration
* TwitchService should leverage offset to collect every stream
* maybe build cache of medium images in bg could be useful
